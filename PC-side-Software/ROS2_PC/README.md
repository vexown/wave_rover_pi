# ROS2 Workspace (ros2_ws)

This directory contains the ROS2 workspace for the Wave Rover Pi project (PC side)

## Structure

A ROS2 workspace typically contains the following directories:

*   **src**: This directory holds the source code of your ROS2 packages.
*   **build**: This directory stores intermediate files generated during the build process.
*   **install**: This directory contains the files installed after a successful build.
*   **log**: This directory contains log files generated by ROS2 nodes.

## Setting up the Workspace

If you have used the Docker_CreateContainer.sh script, your workspace directory is at '~/ros2_ws'
you need to copy the `src` directory (located alongside this README file) into your `~/ros2_ws` directory on the Ubuntu system.
This will make the workspace accessible in the container.

## Building the Workspace

Once inside the container, to build all the packages in the `src` directory, navigate to the root of the workspace (`ros2_ws`) and run:

```bash
colcon build
```

## Sourcing the Workspace

After building, you need to source the `setup.bash` file in the `install` directory to make the packages and executables available in your current terminal session:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

You will need to do this in every new terminal you open to work with this ROS2 workspace.
